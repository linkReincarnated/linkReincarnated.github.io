#About

A quick about the site: it is hosted by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> Pages and powered by the <a href= "http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> engine. It serves as a very general purpose website, hosting my zany blog and anything else I decide I want to do with it. Who knows? I'm sure some unsuspecting part of my brain will completely nerd out on the whole thing at some point.

About me...as you may have gathered, I have a punny sense of humor (read: intolerable), have a huge passion for the life of nerds (Zelda, D&D, and programming, mostly), and am actually quite passionate about life in general. I think we should all take the time to remember what we have, and make sure not to waste it. Other tidbits about me: I play Clarinet, study French alongside Computer Science, have a black belt in Tang Soo Do (and am learning Judo), love reading just about anything, creatively write when in the mood, and am Presbyterian. It is not unlikely that these things will crop up on this website.

Feel free to contact me with questions about the site, corrections of misspelt words, or as a matter of passing interest!
