As the echoing ocarina notes of the song of time fade in the Temple of Time, a strange stone doorway slowly slides open, revealing... a quest bLog?! This is definitely not what our stoic (and silent) hero was expecting.

This is the launch of my new blog, hosted graciously by GitHub Pages, powered by Jekyll, and dedicated to all manner of nerd fun.
